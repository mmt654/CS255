Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  The Client is DriverPass who seek to create an app that allows for students to schedule drive along test with an instructor online while also taking online test and the students will be able to select packages from a list that offer different benefits and the amount of test available.

What did you do particularly well?
  
  I will say that I believe i did the business requirements document the best that lays out all the different system requirments and limitations of the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would say some of the digrams could be better and breakdown the system's uses better and if I could I would improve them by adding more depth to them and expand on them a little bit more.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I tried to implement the user's need to be able to update the database that contains all the information required of the system. It is important to consider the user's needs to ensure that the system will help them reach their goal and that the system will operate as intended and how the user will need it to.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I try to look at the design of the software from an outside perspective and how the end user will see and use it. I would use more diagrams and try to better understand the user requirments and needs in the future to better design and analyze a system.
